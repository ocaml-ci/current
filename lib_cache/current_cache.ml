    (* State model:

       The first time a key is used, a new instance is created in the Retry state.
       Whenever an instance is wanted and we are in Retry, we transition to Active
       and start the Lwt builder process. The only way to leave Active is by the
       Lwt process finishing.

       While Active, we may flag that the value we are setting is out-of-date,
       that the user wants to cancel, or that we should cancel because the build
       is no longer needed. But we still wait for the process to finish,
       possibly encouraging it using [Job.cancel].

       When an Active job finishes:

       - If it was auto-cancelled then we discard the result and return to Retry.
       - Otherwise we store the result on disk.
       - If we need to rebuild (because the user asked for another value during the build)
         then we return to Retry.
       - Otherwise, we move to Finished or Error, depending on whether the operation succeeded.

       In Finished or Error, the user can trigger a rebuild, moving us back to Retry.
       Also, if the user sets a different value then we move to Retry.

       The user can only ask to cancel while we are Active. They can only ask to Rebuild
       when Finished or Error.

       If we reach the scheduled time for a rebuild while in Finished or Error then
       we also move to Retry, but we also continue reporting the previous result
       while rebuilding. *)
